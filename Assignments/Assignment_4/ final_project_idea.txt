My idea:
for this data analytics project I want to examine outbreaks of ebola over the past decade since it first emerged in 1976 near the ebola river. I will recored things like what country the outbreak was in, what the fatality ratio was, what species of ebola virus caused the oubreak, what the recovery rate was for infected people, the latitued and longitude for where the outbreak occured and any other data I can find that might be associated (amount of land deforested in that area that year, bat populations, etc). I would like to take this data and make some graphs trying to show if there is any kind of association between any of these variables and I would also like to use some kind of mapping to show where in the world these outbreaks occured, and how far they spread. I could maybe create some kind of an interactive map that when you click on something it shows a pinpoint of where the specific outbreak occured, the radius of how far it spread, and maybe some general information/ background on the specific outbreak. 

I will use epidemiological/ virology data. There will be character data, numerical data, dates, and location data. These will be the names of the virus species, the location (latitude and longitude) at which the epidemic occured, the date, the number of deaths, the number of recoveries, the deforestation rate in the area for that year, perhaps the bat population in that area the gorilla population, and how the disease outbreak occured/was spreading. Most of this information will be on the cdc website which harbors a lot of epidemiological data. Sources for latitude and logitude will be google. The World Health Organization (WHO) is also a great source of data and statistics on Ebola Virus Diseas (EVD).
